# Getting Started

## Making an Account

Upon the first boot og photocloud, all databases will be empty. Although you'll be prompted at a log in screen, no accounts exist that you can log in with. You'll have to click the **Register** button located furthest to the left in the navbar in order to register a new account. Here, you'll have to come up with a username and password, and confirm the password you enter. You might want to right this down as to not get locked out of your account. Once you've entered your username, password and confirmed your password, click **Register**.

## Logging in

Now, you'll be redirected to the log in page you were at before. Enter the username and password you just came up with, and click **Log In**.
